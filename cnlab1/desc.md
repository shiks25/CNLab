### HUB
It is a broadcasting device which works on the **Physical Layer** in which input from one port results in an output to all ports in the network.

### SWITCH
It is a networking device which works on the **Data Link Layer** and performs the same job as the hub but is considered more smarter than hub as it gathers information about the data packets it receives and forwards it only to the target device in the network.
